## Issue Analysis

### Why Most Repositories Return 404

The skills.laravel.cloud website appears to be a **preview/directory** of upcoming skills that are planned to be published but are not yet public on GitHub. This is evidenced by:

1. **HTTP 404 Errors**: All repositories return "Not Found" errors
2. **110 Total Skills Listed**: Only 11 are shown, suggesting an incomplete directory
3. **Recent Laravel Boost Release**: Laravel Boost v2 was recently released (Feb 2026), and the ecosystem is still developing
