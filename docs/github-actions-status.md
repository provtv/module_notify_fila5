## Required Secrets

### Missing Secrets

| Secret | Purpose | Required By | Status |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `SUBTREE_SSH_KEY` | SSH key for git subtree sync | sync-subtrees.yml | ❌ Missing |
| `BASHSCRIPTS_TOKEN` | GitHub token for bashscripts sync | sync-remote-repo.yml | ✅ Configured |

### How to Create SUBTREE_SSH_KEY

1. Generate SSH key:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions-subtrees"
```

2. Add public key to GitHub account

3. Add private key to repository secrets:
```bash
gh secret set SUBTREE_SSH_KEY < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
