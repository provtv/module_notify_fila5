**File to Edit**:
```
laravel/Themes/Sixteen/resources/views/pages/tests/[slug].blade.php
```

**What**: Add a new section right after `<main>` tag

**Why**: The entire "Featured Content" section is missing from local version

**Exact Code**: See section "FIX HTML (PRIMA DI TUTTO)" in `homepage-structure-diff.md`

**Time**: ~15 minutes

### Task 2: Verify Navbar Toggler Button

**File to Check**:
```
laravel/Themes/Sixteen/resources/views/components/header.blade.php
(or wherever navbar is defined)
```

```
border-bottom, mb-5, flex-column, flex-lg-row, fw-bold, fw-normal,
btn-full, btn-next, card-image-wrapper, col-lg-6, and 23 more...

```

**What to Check**:
- HTML structure match ≥90%
- No errors in build output

## 🎯 Success Criteria

## 💡 Key Principles

Remember REPLIKATE rules:

| Rule | Means |
|------|-------|
| **HTML FIRST** | Fix structure before touching CSS |
| **CSS LAST** | Only modify CSS after HTML is correct |
| **NO Bootstrap** | Use Tailwind @apply instead |
| **DRY** | One blade file, reusable blocks |
| **KISS** | Blade=structure, JSON=content, CSS=style |

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **DON'T** touch CSS before HTML is fixed  
❌ **DON'T** add Bootstrap classes  
❌ **DON'T** hardcode text in blade (use JSON)  
❌ **DON'T** skip reading the analysis document  
❌ **DON'T** modify multiple components at once (test each change)  

✅ **DO** follow tasks in order  
✅ **DO** test after each change  
✅ **DO** use automation script to verify  
✅ **DO** document what you changed  
✅ **DO** ask if something is unclear
