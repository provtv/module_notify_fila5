## ✅ Code Quality Standards

### Cyclomatic Complexity

- **Maximum complexity per method: 10**
- Methods with complexity > 10 must be refactored
- Use design patterns to reduce complexity

### PHPStan

- **Minimum level: 3**
- All code must pass PHPStan analysis
- No errors allowed in CI/CD pipeline

### Code Style

- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use Laravel Pint for automatic formatting
- Run `./vendor/bin/pint` before committing

### Architecture

- Follow SOLID principles
- Use design patterns appropriately
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Extend XotBase classes (see [LARAXOT_FRAMEWORK_RULES.md](.windsurf/rules/LARAXOT_FRAMEWORK_RULES.md))

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- **Minimum coverage: 80%**
- All new features must have tests
- All bug fixes must have regression tests

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual methods and classes
   - Mock dependencies
   - Fast execution

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test component interactions
   - Use real dependencies when appropriate
   - Test complete workflows

3. **Feature Tests**
   - Test user-facing features
   - Test HTTP requests and responses
   - Test database interactions

### Writing Tests

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use App\Services\YourService;

test('your service does something', function (): void {
    $service = new YourService();
    
    $result = $service->doSomething();
    
    expect($result)->toBe('expected_value');
});

test('your service handles errors', function (): void {
    $service = new YourService();
    
    expect(fn() => $service->doSomethingInvalid())
        ->toThrow(InvalidArgumentException::class);
});
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Design Patterns

Use appropriate design patterns to reduce complexity:

- **Command Pattern**: For command handlers
- **Strategy Pattern**: For interchangeable algorithms
- **Factory Pattern**: For object creation
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access
- **Service Pattern**: For business logic

### Refactoring

When refactoring complex code:

1. Write tests first (if not present)
2. Extract methods to reduce complexity
3. Use design patterns
4. Validate with PHPStan
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Update documentation

### Documentation

- Add PHPDoc blocks to all public methods
- Document complex algorithms
- Update README when adding features
- Keep changelog up to date
