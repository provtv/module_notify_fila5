### Best Practices
```php
// Always use Form Requests
public function store(StoreTicketRequest $request)

// Never use raw queries
Ticket::where('id', $id)->first(); // ✅ SAFE
DB::raw("SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE id = $id"); // ❌ UNSAFE

// Always escape output
{{ $ticket->name }} // ✅ Escaped
{!! $ticket->name !!} // ❌ Unescaped - only for trusted content
```
