# GitHub Issues Guide - Design Comuni Replication

## Overview
This guide explains how to use the GitHub issue templates for the Design Comuni replication project.

## Issue Templates

### 1. Epic Issues
**Template**: `epic-*.md`  
**Purpose**: Track high-level phases of the project  
**When to use**: At the start of each phase (6 epics total)

**Structure**:
- Epic overview with goals
- Timeline and status
- Child issues list
- Acceptance criteria
- Definition of Done

**Example**:
```
Epic #1: Foundation & Homepage (Weeks 1-2)
Epic #2: List Pages (Weeks 3-4)

```

### 2. Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
**Template**: `adr-architecture-decision.md`  
**Purpose**: Document important architectural decisions  
**When to use**: Before implementing major technical changes

**Structure**:
- Status (Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated)
- Context (problem statement)
- Decision (proposed solution)
- Consequences (positive/negative)
- Implementation plan
- Validation criteria

**Example ADRs**:
- ADR: Use Tailwind @apply instead of Bootstrap Italia CDN
- ADR: Single [slug].blade.php for all pages
- ADR: JSON-driven content blocks

### 3. Component Implementation
**Template**: `component-implementation.md`  
**Purpose**: Track implementation of reusable components  
**When to use**: For each of the 47 components

**Structure**:
- Component name and type
- Design references (URLs)
- Implementation plan (Blade, CSS, JS)
- Acceptance criteria
- Testing strategy
- Definition of Done

**Component Tiers**:
- **Tier 1** (7 components): Critical - implement first
- **Tier 2** (12 components): High priority
- **Tier 3** (15 components): Medium priority
- **Tier 4** (8 components): Low priority
- **Tier 5** (5 components): Specialized

**Example**:
```
Component: Hero Section
Type: Layout
Priority: Tier 1
Used by: Homepage, Detail pages, Event pages
```

---

### 4. Page Implementation
**Template**: `page-implementation.md`  
**Purpose**: Track replication of individual pages  
**When to use**: For each of the 38 pages

**Structure**:
- Source and target URLs
- JSON content file structure
- Component dependencies
- HTML parity checklist
- Visual parity checklist
- Screenshot analysis requirements
- Testing strategy

**Page Categories**:
- **General** (9 pages): Homepage, Topics, Administration, etc.
- **Amministrazione** (2 pages): Administration, Documents & Data

## Best Practices

### Issue Titles
- **Clear and specific**: "Component: Hero Section" NOT "New component"
- **Include type**: Start with "Component:", "Page:", "Epic:", "ADR:"
- **Include URL**: For pages, include `/it/tests/[slug]`

### Issue Descriptions
- **Fill all sections**: Don't leave sections blank
- **Add screenshots**: Visual comparison is critical
- **Link related issues**: Use "Depends on", "Blocks", "Related to"
- **Be specific**: Exact file paths, exact URLs, exact metrics

### Comments
- **Progress updates**: Comment daily with progress
- **Blockers**: Comment immediately if blocked
- **Questions**: Ask questions in comments, tag relevant people
- **Decisions**: Document decisions in comments

---

## Integration with Other Tools

### GSD Workflow
- Issues link to `.planning/ROADMAP.md` phases

- ADRs stored in `docs/project/adr/`
- Component docs in `Themes/Sixteen/docs/`

### OpenViking
- Project context stored in OpenViking
- Issues reference OpenViking memories
- Decisions synced to OpenViking

## Metrics

### Velocity
- Issues completed per week
- Points completed per sprint
- Cycle time (create → close)

### Quality

## Troubleshooting

### Issue Too Vague
**Problem**: Issue description is unclear  
**Solution**: Add more details, screenshots, examples, acceptance criteria

### Issue Too Large
**Problem**: Issue covers too much work  
**Solution**: Break into smaller sub-issues, create checklist

### Blocked Issue
**Problem**: Cannot proceed due to dependency ADR, dependency  
**Solution**: 
1. Comment "BLOCKED: [reason]"
2. Tag relevant team members
3. Create dependency issue if needed
4. Move to next sprint

### Duplicate Issue
**Problem**: Issue already exists  
**Solution**: 
1. Comment "Duplicate of #[issue number]"
2. Close issue
3. Link to original issue
